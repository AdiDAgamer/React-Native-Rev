            React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Web and UWP by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities.

            Now what I understand from react native is that it's a mixture of Java and HTML, also known as jsx.

            React has it's own library of components, which we import to our projects. 
            You have to import specific components which you want to use in your project. 
            There are some basic components like Text, Button, view, etc. The Text component, 
            as it's name suggests, is used to write texts. The button component is used to create 
            buttons in your project. The view component, is like div tag in html, is used to 
            seperate different styles. For example, <div class="eg1">this is style is different</div> from 
            <div class="eg2">this style. </div> hehe.

            There is much to do with jsx. The 'render' function is used to display what you have written/created inside the function. 
            Remember JSON format? Where you define properties inside '{}'? Here, you have to put double '{}' ( {{}} ) insted because '{}' is for 
            using Java, and you use the JSON format inside Java, so you put double '{}'.
